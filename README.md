<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./public/preview.png)

I made this project as a practice to get started with NextJs, the web is deployed in [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and you can see the demo [here](https://upload-image-omega.vercel.app/).
I had already experience working with NodeJs and React but I wanted to make the next step and try NextJs. And I think this was a good project to get started.

Doing the project I learnt a lot about how to work with NextJs with the API routes and with some features like the document component.

### Built With

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- **User story**: I can drag and drop an image to upload it
- **User story**: I can choose to select an image from my folder
- **User story**: I can see a loader when uploading
- **User story**: When the image is uploaded, I can see the image and copy it
- **User story**: I can choose to copy to the clipboard
